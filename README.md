# Quantum Core X

[![.NET Pipeline](https://github.com/MeikelLP/quantum-core-x/actions/workflows/dotnet-pipeline.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/MeikelLP/quantum-core-x/actions/workflows/dotnet-pipeline.yml)

**QCX** (Quantum Core X) is an open source implementation of the Metin2 server.

This project is a fork of [QuantumCore C#](https://gitlab.com/quantum-core/core-dotnet/) and will not be backward compatible. This fork has the goal to extend from what has already been implemented and make the project as maintainable and modern as possible while also implementing more and more of the missing features.
