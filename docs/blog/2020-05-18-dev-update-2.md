## Attacking

The main change of this development update is the implementation of basic attacking (Merged [!20](https://gitlab.com/quantum-core/core/-/merge_requests/20)).
Currently we didn't implemented 100% attack nor defense calculation, but basic functionality is in place.

- Monsters are chasing you
- Monsters are attacking you when they are in range
- Groups will target the player after first attack
- Monsters are targeting the player which dealt the most damage
- The player is able to die and respawn (town is currently respawning here too)

Look at the short video showing fighting, chasing and dying.
